        <p>About:
            I like to build on my free time for some fun. It really relaxes you out. Legos are most common and easier to do because it gives you instructions which can be lots of hard work incase the legos you built fall down it would take lots of work rebuilding depending on how big it is. Normal builds dont have instructions but can use imagination (mental image) To think what to build next. It can be really fun and relaxing and thats why I like building so much.
